I created Node3D to act as a game_world.tscn scene node. 
I created DirectionalLight3D to allow CharacterBody3D better see StaticBody3D2 from perspective of CharacterBody3D.
I created StaticBody3D with subnodes of BoxMesh MeshInstance3D for visiblity and BoxShape CollisionShape3D to act as a floor for CharacterBody3D.
I created StaticBody3D2 with subnodes of BoxMesh MeshInstance3D for visiblity and BoxShape CollisionShape3D to act as a second floor for CharacterBody3D to look at, walk and jump on.
I created a CharacterBody3D with subnodes of CapsuleMesh MeshInstance3D for visiblity and CapsuleShape CollisionShape3D for interaction with the CharacterBody3D floor. I also added subnode of Camera3D to see from the perspective of CharacterBody3D. I attached built-in script CharacterBody3D: Basic Movement and saved as character_body_3d.gd to jump and allow control movement of CharacterBody3D Node.
